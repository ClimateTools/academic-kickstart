Asian speleothem $\delta^{18}$O has been widely used to study paleo-hydroclimate
variability due to its high dating precisions and fine temporal resolutions up
to years. It was traditionally thought to represent the "monsoon intensity",
however, recent studies have shown that it can be regulated by water vapor
transport or the "upstream effect", with the related large-scale circulation
variability. To understand the contribution of different processes controlling
Asian speleothem $\delta^{18}$O, we employ an isotope-enabled model iCESM and track life
cycles of water vapor originating from different regions. We found that at
orbital scales, Asian speleothem $\delta^{18}$O mainly reflects the meridional migration
of the monsoon circulation, rather than regional precipitation amount. At
interannual scales, Asian speleothem $\delta^{18}$O is mainly tied to a change in
moisture source locations.
