My research focuses on the long-term variability of the atmosphere-ocean system in the past. I am interested in understanding the mechanisms of the climate system, so we can better predict the future climate change. To fulfil this goal, I use climate models, synthesis of (paleo)climate data, and statistical analysis. My past work includes using speleothem data to understand the Asian climate variability at orbital to centennial scales, the interpretation of stable isotopic signals in speleothems and ice cores, and evaluating/improving water isotope-enabled climate models. I am also interested in the novel usage of stable water isotopes in modern climate (e.g., convective mixing of low clouds, large-scale organized convection).
